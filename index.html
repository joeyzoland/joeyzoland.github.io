        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <br>
        <p>

          I grew up in the Silicon Valley and was exposed to technology at a very early age.  My very first personal interactions occurred when I was 1.5 years old, clearing levels of Mario Bros. 2.  When later pursuing my MA in Psychology, I blended my passions for technology and educational psychology to create, <a href = https://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=7954&context=etd_theses>"Attention Restoration Theory in Gaming as it Pertains to Subsequent Academic Learning."</a>
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          In many ways, I truly started my career at KeepTruckin.  In December of 2018, I became the first Software Engineer in their Customer Support department.  Within the first 10 months, I created a Python tool that translates and aggregates vehicle fault codes, investigated several hundred software issues for our clients, and interviewed software engineers to join my team.  Following all this, I was promoted to Senior Software Support Engineer.  Afterwards, I was in charge of communicating all customer sentiment around our software issues to VP and C-level executives, as well as manage a team of Software Support Engineers and act as the personal liaisson for one of our three biggest clients.

        <p>
          My latest adventure is DigitalOcean, which I joined as a Manager of Cloud Support during the end of its startup days in September of 2020. I provided a much needed sense of stability to a Support organization that lost both of its other managers within 2 weeks of my starting.  Even though I took on 24 direct reports for much of my first year at DigitalOcean, I received 100% manager approval and 98% engagement ratings from them, both 20 percentage points higher than the company average.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          Since DigitalOcean's move to the public sector, I have hired on multiple managers and direct reports as the most tenured member of the Cloud Support Team.  In addition to managing people and projects, I act as the team's go-to resource for most data analytics tasks including workforce management: One of my most comprehensive Google Sheets projects for both short-term PTO management and workforce staffing is included in the next section.  Along these lines, I learned a great deal with my recent completion of <a href = https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/V7GWJHTF832B>Google's Professional Data Analytics Certification Program.</a>
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
          Every day I strive to utilize my MA in Psychology to understand and then work with my direct reports to reach their full potential, all while utilizing my engineering skills to analyze data and build tools that facilitate team efficiency.
